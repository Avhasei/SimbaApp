The app runs OkHTTP, immedietely when the app is opend in the onCreate function on the MainActivitiy class, then I stores the json array to be used for later.

When the "Show List" button is pressed then it goes and retrieves the json array where I then run a forLoop to go through and display all the names on a AlertDialog alert.

When the "Show User" button more like the "Show List" button I do the same, just that now I have also included an if statement to only display the email address of the username "Samantha" within the array.
